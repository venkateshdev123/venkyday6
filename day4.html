<p>Dhoni was acquired by Chennai Super Kings (CSK) for US$1.5 million during the auction for the inaugural season of the Indian Premier League (IPL). He was the most expensive signing in the auction.[121] Dhoni scored 414 runs to lead CSK to the finals in the first season of IPL.[122] Under his captaincy, CSK won the 2010 season and qualified for Champions League Twenty20.[123] Chennai won the 2010 Champions league.[124] Dhoni scored 392 runs and led CSK to its second consecutive IPL title in 2011.[125] Dhoni led CSK to its second Champions League Twenty20 title in 2014.[126] Dhoni scored 2987 runs from 129 matches in the IPL across the first eight seasons for the Super Kings.[122]


Dhoni with Chennai Super Kings in 2011
Following the two-year suspension of Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals, two new franchises Rising Pune Supergiants and Gujarat Lions were established for the 2016 Indian Premier League season. Supergiants picked Dhoni as one of their five draft picks on 15 December 2015 for ₹125 million (US$1.6 million).[127] He scored 574 runs in 30 matches across two seasons for the Supergiants.[122]

Dhoni returned to Chennai Super Kings for the 2018 season.[128] Dhoni scored 455 runs in the season and led CSK to its third IPL title.[129] Dhoni led CSK to the title again in 2021 and was retained by CSK for ₹12 crore (US$1.5 million) before the auction for 2022 season.[130] He stepped down from the captaincy of CSK on 24 March 2022 and Ravindra Jadeja was appointed as the new captain.[131][132] However, on 30 April 2022, Jadeja handed over the captaincy back to Dhoni in the middle of the season.[133] Dhoni led the franchise to victory in the 2023 IPL season.[125] Under his captaincy, CSK became the most successful IPL franchise with five title wins and ten final appearances.[134] MS Dhoni became the first player to play 200 T20 matches for Super Kings and holds the record for most appearances in the IPL.[135]</p>
